### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>=14.0.0)
- MongoDb (or a compatible database)
- Environment variables for configuration

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   
bash
   git clone https://github.com/rjv450/Role-Based-Access-Control-System.git
   cd Role-Based-Access-Control-System/backend

2. **Install Dependencies**
bash
   npm install

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
   
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/comment-rb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_secret
PORT=port number


4. **Start the Servers**
bash
   npm run start

5. **Run Tests**
bash
   npm run test

After running the tests, Jest will generate a coverage directory in your project's root folder. Inside this coverage folder, you'll find an index.html file.
